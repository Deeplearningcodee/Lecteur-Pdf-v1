# Project Execution Demonstration
In this section, we will review the necessary steps to clone, install, and run the project.

## Step 1: Cloning from GitHub
The first step to get the project is to clone it from its GitHub repository. To do this, use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL.

git clone https://github.com/Deeplearningcodee/Lecteur-Pdf-v1.git

After running this command, you should have a local copy of the repository on your machine.

## Step 2: Installing dependencies
Once you have cloned the project, the next step is to install the necessary dependencies. These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file located at the root of the project.

To install these dependencies, you will need to use pip, the Python package manager. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This command tells pip to read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the packages listed there. Make sure you are in the same directory as the `requirements.txt` file when you run this command, otherwise pip will not be able to find the file.

Once you have run this command, pip will start installing the dependencies. This can take a few minutes, depending on the number of dependencies to install and the speed of your internet connection.

## Step 3: Running the project
Now that the project is installed and configured, we can run it. To do this, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the `main.py` file with Python.

cd path/to/project
python main.py

After executing these commands, you should see the project running.
